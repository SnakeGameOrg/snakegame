# Snake Game
A simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C++. This game uses the SFML library for graphics.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
To run this program, you need to have SFML installed on your system. You can download SFML from the official website: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

## How to play
Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the snake. The objective is to eat as many food pellets as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's body. The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
